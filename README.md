Hi, I am Nicole Georgieva


About me
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am 16 years old girl from Kyustendil, Bulgaria. 👧

I am currently studying in 11th grade.  In school, I extensively study Math, Informatics and ICT. These are 
my favourite subjects. 💻

I have fundamental knowledge at C# and C++ and I’m currently focused on Java. I study at Software University (SoftUni) and gain new skills every day.
Like all students, I also have other interests. Ten years ago, I started training volleyball and that’s my biggest passion. I also love listening to music, doing puzzles and taking walks in the forest. 🏐

From my first touch to it, programming grabbed me. I like creating new things and developing new features. All the technologies are very interesting to me and I want to learn more and more, because the more you learn, the cooler things you do. 😊
